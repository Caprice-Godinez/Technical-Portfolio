## Key Takeaway
Completing these labs provided a structured progression through the **core competencies of the RHCSA certification**, reinforcing both foundational and advanced Linux system administration skills. Beyond mastering commands in isolation, the labs emphasized real-world application — configuring users and permissions, managing storage, automating tasks, securing services, and troubleshooting system-level issues. The experience not only built confidence in Red Hat–based environments but also deepened my understanding of how Linux administration/general system administration concepts underpin enterprise IT operations and security.
