# Part 1

## Objective
- Manage files, redirect a specific set of lines from a text file to another file, and edit the text files.

---

## Overview / Directions
- Created the /home/student/grading directory.
- Created three empty files called grade1, grade2, and grade3, in the /home/student/grading directory.
- Captured the first five lines of the /home/student/bin/manage file in the /home/student/grading/review.txt file.
- Appended the last three lines of the /home/student/bin/manage file to the /home/student/grading/review.txt file. Did not overwrite any existing text in the /home/student/grading/review.txt file.
- Copied the /home/student/grading/review.txt file to the /home/student/grading/review-copy.txt file.
- Edited the /home/student/grading/review-copy.txt file so that the Test JJ line appears twice.
- Edited the /home/student/grading/review-copy.txt file to remove the Test HH line.
- Edited the /home/student/grading/review-copy.txt file so that a line with A new line exists between the Test BB line and the Test CC line.
- Created the /home/student/hardcopy hard link to the /home/student/grading/grade1 file. Created the hard link after completing the earlier step to create the /home/student/grading/grade1 file.
- Created the /home/student/softcopy symbolic link to the /home/student/grading/grade2 file.
- Saved the output of a command that lists the contents of the /boot directory to the /home/student/grading/longlisting.txt file. The output was a "long listing" that includes file permissions, owner and group owner, size, and modification date of each file. The output omitted hidden files.
