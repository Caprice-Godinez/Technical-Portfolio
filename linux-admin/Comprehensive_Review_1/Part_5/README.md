## Overview / Directions
- Identifed the unmounted block device that contains an XFS file system on the serverb machine. Mounted the block device on the /review5-disk directory.
- Located the review5-path file. Created the /review5-disk/review5-path.txt file that contains a single line with the absolute path to the review5-path file.
- Located all the files that the contractor1 user and the contractor group own. Ensured the files must have the 640 octal permissions. Saved the list of these files in the /review5-disk/review5-perms.txt file.
- Located all files with a size of 100 bytes. Saved the absolute paths of these files in the /review5- disk/review5-size.txt file.
- Logged in to the serverb machine as the student user and switched to the root user.
