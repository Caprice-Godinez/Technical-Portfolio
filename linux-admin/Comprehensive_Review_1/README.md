## Key Takeaway
While creating this project, I strengthened my **problem-solving skills, adaptability, and logical thinking** by breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps. I chose a list to manage the playlist, but I recognized that a dictionary offered a more efficient solution to handle duplication errors and enable faster key-value lookups. These skills directly transfer to real-world scenarios where **troubleshooting, persistence, and clear organization/documentation** are essential for success.
