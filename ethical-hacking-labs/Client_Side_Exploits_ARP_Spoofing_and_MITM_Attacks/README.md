# Client Side Exploitations and ARP Spoofing / MiTM Attacks

## Objective
Topology: OpenSUSE, pfSense, OWASP BWA, and Kali

- Hook and exploit a web browser with the BeEF framework.
- Conduct an ARP spoof and MiTM attack. 

---

## Overview / Directions
**Client Side Exploitations**

1. Deployed BeEF in a Kali Linux environment and accessed the web control panel.

2. Hooked a target Firefox browser via a demo page, confirming connection in the BeEF console.

3. Captured keystrokes and monitored user input through the logging interface.

4. Executed exploitation modules including browser fingerprinting and toolbar detection.

5. Simulated a social engineering attack by displaying a fake notification bar in Firefox.

6. Captured sensitive information (e.g., fake form data such as credit card input) through BeEF’s keylogging and input-capturing modules.

**ARP Spoofing / MiTM Attack**

1. Configured Kali Linux for LAN access and launched Ettercap in GUI mode.

2. Performed host discovery and targeted both the OpenSUSE victim machine and the pfSense firewall.

3. Executed ARP poisoning to place the attacker in the middle of victim communications.

4. Captured HTTP credentials (username/passwords) from a login session to pfSense.

5. Applied a custom filter to manipulate web traffic.

6. Replaced all images on a target website with a custom hosted image.

7. Injected JavaScript alerts into legitimate web pages to simulate code injection.

## Key Takeaway
Hands-on experience with both **client-side exploitation** and **ARP/MITM attacks** highlighted how attackers chain different techniques to compromise systems — from tricking end users into executing malicious code to silently intercepting sensitive traffic on a network. This reinforced not just the technical mechanics of exploitation, but also the importance of layered defenses (patch management, user awareness, and network monitoring) in preventing such attacks.
