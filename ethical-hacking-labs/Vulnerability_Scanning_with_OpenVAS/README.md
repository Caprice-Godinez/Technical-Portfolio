# Vulnerability Scanning with OpenVAS

## Objective
Topology: OWASP BWA, pfSense, Kali

- Conduct a quick and customized vulnerability scan with OpenVas.

---

## Overview / Directions
**OpenVAS**

1. Launched OpenVAS, learned the different types of categories and calculations used to conduct a vulnerability assessment (network vulnerability tests (NVT) by severity and common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS), and common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) by CVSS and severity).

2. Conducted a quick scan on the OWASP server and viewed the full vulnerability report. Conducted a 'full and very deep ultimate' scan on the OWASP server and reviewed the full vulnerability report.

## Key Takeaway
This lab reinforced my ability to conduct both quick and in-depth vulnerability scans using OpenVAS, while **interpreting CVSS scores and CVE data** to assess risk. By reviewing full vulnerability reports, I strengthened my analytical skills and attention to detail in identifying potential system weaknesses. These abilities directly transfer to real-world cybersecurity work, where **assessing and prioritizing vulnerabilities** is essential for **maintaining secure systems**.
