## Overview
7 hands-on simulated labs that demonstrate key ethical hacking concepts such as:
- Footprinting
- Reconnaissance
- Scanning
- Enumeration
- Sniffing
- Evasion
- System Hacking
- Social Engineering
- Web-Based Hacking: Servers and Applications
- Trojans and Other Attacks
- Cryptography

## Key Takeaway
These labs gave me more than just technical practice, they taught me to approach problems the way a threat actor would. By moving through everything from reconnaissance to system exploitation, I built not only hands-on skills but also a **mindset for anticipating and mitigating threats**. That shift in perspective is what makes me **stronger in both offensive and defensive security** work.
