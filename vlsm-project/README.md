# VLSM Project

## Objective
Design an appropriate VLSM addressing scheme for 11 network topologies by hand.

---

## Overview / Directions
Maximized the number of host addresses at each level of subnetting for the following IP addresses:
- 220.10.10.0/24 with 88 hosts
- 192.168.16.0/24 with 200 hosts
- 192.168.1.0/24 with 93 hosts
- 195.109.74.0/24 with 60 hosts
- 200.124.67.0/24 with 177 hosts
- 172.16.8.0/22 with 552 hosts
- 190.12.40.0/23 with 353 hosts
- 134.14.8.0/22 with 830 hosts
- 64.64.20.0/22 with 722 hosts
- 160.59.128.0/19 with 3,014 hosts
- 137.24.48.0/21 with 717 hosts

## Key Takeaway
It was deeply challenging to manage my time and ensure manual accuracy. However, by manually subnetting and designing 11 unique network toplologies I developed **precision, mathematical reasoning, and a deeper understanding** of IP addressing.  This ensures that I can **maximize limited address space, design, and troubleshoot** multiple types of networks.
